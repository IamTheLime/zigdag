  OpenPricing - Compile-Time Engine
==============================================

Pricing Model Information:
  - JSON parsed at: COMPILE TIME
  - Graph validated at: COMPILE TIME
  - Nodes in model: 4
  - Node storage: STACK (no heap!)
  - Execution: FULLY INLINED

Compile-Time Node Information:
  [constant_input_num] Constant (Number)
      Description: This is the whatever
      Value: 33.3
  [constant_input_num] Constant (Number)
      Description: Hardcoded numeric value
      Value: 100
  [add] Add
      Description: Addition (a + b)
      Inputs: constant_input_num_2, constant_input_num_1
  [add] Add
      Description: Addition (a + b)
      Inputs: constant_input_num_2, add_3

Running example calculation...
  Add: $233.30

Performance Characteristics:
  - JSON parsing: ZERO (done at compile time)
  - Graph validation: ZERO (done at compile time)
  - Memory allocation: Minimal (just input hashmap)
  - Execution: Pure computation (fully inlined)
  - Node values: Stack-allocated array

Code Generation:
  The execute() function is completely inlined.
  At runtime, this is just a few arithmetic operations!
  No loops, no conditionals, no overhead.

Workflow:
  1. Design model in frontend (React Flow UI)
  2. Export JSON to models/pricing_model.json
  3. Rebuild - nodes auto-generated at compile time!
  4. New model is baked into the binary
  5. Use from Python with ctypes/cffi
  6. Enjoy ZERO-OVERHEAD pricing calculations!
