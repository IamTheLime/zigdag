[X] Sort out topological sort for dependencies - DONE: Implemented Kahn's algorithm for DAG topological sorting
[X] Start using tagged unions for all of the nodes in the system, it will provide better
    typing and stricter definitions of the system we are trying to build - DONE: Refactored to use NodeOperation union
[X] Update JSON parsing and code generation to support union-based operations - DONE
[] Figure out to create nodes that use enums as part of their logic, and more complex pricing model nodes that require mappings - IN PROGRESS
[] Implement FFI interface for setting dynamic input values at runtime
[] Add validation for dynamic inputs against allowed_values
[] Enhance conditional_value_input with proper value mapping support
